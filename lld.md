✅ “We can achieve OCP using Abstraction and Polymorphism.”
✅ “We should extend behavior using new classes, not by modifying existing logic.”
✅ “Most design patterns (like Strategy, Factory, Decorator) exist to support OCP.”


“LSP ensures subclass behavior does not surprise or break parent expectations.”

“It helps maintain polymorphism safely.”

“You can detect LSP violations when you see overridden methods throwing exceptions or changing logic unexpectedly.”


“ISP prevents side effects when adding new implementations.”

“It encourages small, focused interfaces for specific roles.”

“It keeps code modular and supports clean dependency inversion.”
