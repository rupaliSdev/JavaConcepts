/*    Annotations provide metadata about Java code, which can be used by the
    compiler or at runtime.
    Annotations on types (classes, interfaces, enums) are used to provide
    additional information or behavior to the types.
    Examples include @Override (ensures that a method overrides a superclass
    method), @Deprecated (marks a method or class as obsolete), and custom
    annotations for framework-specific or application-specific behavior.
    Annotations enhance code readability, maintainability, and provide a way to
    convey semantics or constraints to the Java compiler or runtime environment*/
