**52. Explain the difference between throw and throws keywords in Java.**
    Answer:
    • throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or
    block of code.
    • throws keyword is used in the method signature to indicate that the
    method may throw one or more exceptions, and the responsibility of
    handling those exceptions is delegated to the caller method or the JVM.
