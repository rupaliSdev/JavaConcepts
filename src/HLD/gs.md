Round 6: LLD + HLD + Databases
The final technical round was deep-dive into design:

LLD & HLD of an E-commerce Platform
Cart, Orders, Payments
How to handle scaling and reliability
2. Database Internals

How indexing works internally
How NoSQL stores data and how queries are optimized
3.Trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL in real-world scenarios

This round required both breadth and depth of system knowledge.


DSA: Practice standard LeetCode problems (focus on graphs, strings, and backtracking).
Java: Understand thread pools, synchronization, and how concurrency works in backend systems in addition to other core Java concepts.
System Design: Be ready for both high-level (HLD) and low-level design (LLD). Common systems design question include e-commerce, notification system, and caching.
Git & Engineering Practices: Know practical workflows (branching, CI/CD basics, deployments).

Explain how you're using SDLC in your organization. (In-depth answer required).
They want to know how code-reviews and code-merge is done. How build and release is maintained. What's the development model you're following (In my case it was incremental model)What are the testing mechanisms? How JUnits, Regression Testing, and Load/Performance testing is done,
How the customer is getting the upcoming changes? (Details about release cycle)
How do you handle cases of regression?
