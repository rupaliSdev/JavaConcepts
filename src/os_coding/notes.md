Discussion around handling multiple incoming requests via ThreadPool.
Concurrency — Coding-style discussion: multi-threading, locks, race conditions, BlockingQueue, thread-safety.

Abstract Class vs Interface (When to use when)
OOPs, concepts used in your J2EE Framework (Not your project - Here they want to know how well you know Core Java concepts used behind J2EE frameworks)For Example Managed Beans follows the concept of Encapsulation. Program to an interface and not the class - Polymorphism.
Question on Java Collection
Singleton class and ways to achieve that (Deep Discussion on Early Initialization vs Late Initialization vs Bill Pugh)

What is Transfer learning (Intuition and Methodologies) (Based on my deep learning project)
Design a suitable data structure to play a game of Jigsaw Puzzle.- From this, some 2-D matrix questions were asked. (Rotate matrix in 90, 180, 270 degree)
All possible questions on Java Collections:
Internal working of HashSet
ArrayList vs LinkedList (In terms of usage)
Hashtable vs HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap
Round 8: Face to Face Interview (Bar Raiser Type) Duration: 1-1.5 hours so far, this was the toughest of all.
1. He directly jumped to HashMap's internal working. He asked do you know about "Treefy Factor"?
   I explained it. From Java 8, this change was introduced.
   When the size of the linked list in any bucket exceeds some factor, the LinkedList is converted into self-balanced BST.
   Counter Questions:
   Given Employee class, if we don't override hashcode() and equals(), will it work in HashMap? (Yes, Object class which is the parent of every class have hashcode() and equals())Hence it will work, but might cause some performance issue.
   For the same Employee class, TreeMap will work? (No -> We need to implement custom comparator)
   What happens to treefy factor when we use HashMap? In this case, to convert LL into BST, we need some kind of comparison logic. Hence if the comparator/comparable is not implemented it will not convert LL into BST. But, there will not be any error.
2. Implement a suitable data structure for which following operations are done in O(1)
   insert(int element)
   delete (int element)
   getRandom() -> Return any element from Data Structure with equal probability
3. Design a Bank Account in Multi-Threaded Environments. (Most Interesting Discussion)
   Requirements:
   Implement void debit(), void credit(), int getBalance(), List getLast5Txn()
   debit() and credit() should not be executed concurrently to mitigate dirty read-write.
   In any case getBalance() and getLast5Txn() should not be blocked. (Even if it's dirty read, we should allow that)
   Solution:
   Simply putting synchronized before debit() and credit() won't work. As per theinternal working when you put synchronized on any instance method, whole object will be locked.So in this case getBalance() and getLast5Txn() will be locked even when we didn't put the synchronized keyword.
   Maintain balance variable in another class and at the time of debit() and credit(), acquire the lock on the new class (Using Synchronized block)
   Use Readers Writers Lock
   Counter Questions:
   when synchronized is used with static method, what happens? -> Lock is acquired on class level
   Given some examples, where he added synchronized on some instance/static methods and asked what happens in this case or in that case?
   Method level Synchronization vs Block Level Synchronization?
4. Find first non-repeating character in very long string.link: Given a string, find its first non-repeating character
   After this, he modified the question, now m machines and n cores are given.
   Modify the above algorithm to leverage the power of the Multi-Cluster System.
   With some hints, I was able to design an algorithm (Based on Map-Reduce framework)
   Then, HR came and asked some basic questions. After which, he informed me I am done for the day.
